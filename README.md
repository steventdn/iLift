## Getting Started

This app is called iLift. It is a workout log app that users can log their workouts and personal records.
You can add instances of your workout in the Workout Tab and then view them in the Progress Page. I built this app
to learn more about Android Development and Cloud Firestore.

You can either download the App on the Google Play Store or run the code in an Android Emulator such as on Android Studio.
